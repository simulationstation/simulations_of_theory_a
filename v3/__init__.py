v3 - Enhanced Cosmological Natural Selection Model

This package extends v2 with:
- Cosmic star formation history (CSFH)
- Redshift-integrated BH formation rate
- More realistic N_BH(Omega_Lambda) dependence

Key improvement over v2:
- v2: N_BH from halo count at single redshift
- v3: N_BH from integral over cosmic history with SFR weighting
